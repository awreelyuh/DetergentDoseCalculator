# Detergent Dose Calculator
As my capstone project for Code Kentucky's Software Development Course Part 1, this console application was developed to simplify the setup of a wash routine for parents who want to use cloth diapers.

The app gets input from the user on their detergent choice as well as washer capacity, runs the numbers through a formula within the logic, and outputs the recommended detergent dose. Data is based on information available on [Clean Cloth Nappies](https://cleanclothnappies.com/)' [AU/NZ Detergent Index](https://cleanclothnappies.com/detergents/).

The plan is to eventually develop this into a full web app that can be used by subscription members of the Clean Cloth Nappies website.

## Features
The following items from the "Feature List" are implemented:

- Implement a "master loop" console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
- Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application

## Notes & Instructions
As the data used in this application is based on Australian and New Zealand products, the capacity of washing machines is in kilograms (instead of cubic feet) and the brand names of detergents may not be familiar to North American users.

When typing out your chosen detergent from the list, you will have to follow the case of the full brand name displayed for valid input.
